### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kyle McDonald

During my day to day, I write software over at [Knock](https://github.com/knocklabs). I primarily focus on the front-end, more specifically React, but I like to go down lots of rabbit holes.

Personal macOS bootstrap that turns a fresh Mac into my dev environment with one command. Uses Nix flakes with nix-darwin and Home Manager to install apps and CLI tools, apply dotfiles, and set sensible macOS defaults.

My personal site where you can find what I've been up to day to day, my writings, and more. This is my playground for trying new things.
