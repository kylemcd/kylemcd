### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kyle McDonald

During my day to day, I write software over at [Knock](https://github.com/knocklabs). I primarily focus on the front-end, more specifically React, but I like to go down lots of rabbit holes. 

#### ðŸš€ Open Source Work

[Telegraph Design System](https://github.com/knocklabs/telegraph)
The open source design system used at [Knock](https://knock.app)

[dotfiles (neovim, oh-my-zsh, tmux)](https://github.com/kylemcd.com/dotfiles)
This is where I keep all my config (that changes quite frequently) for my local tooling.
   
[personal-site](https://github.com/kylemcd/personal-site) - [kylemcd.com](https://kylemcd.com)
My personal site where you can find what I've been up to day to day, my writings, and more. This is my playground for trying new things.
