### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kyle McDonald

During my day to day, I run the engineering organization over at [@foxtrotco](https://github.com/foxtrotco). I primarily focus on the front-end, more specifically React, but I like to go down lots of rabbit holes. 

ðŸš€ Open Source Work: 

dotfiles (neovim, oh-my-zsh, tmux)](https://github.com/kylemcd.com/dotfiles)
   - This is where I keep all my config (that changes quite frequently) for my local tooling.
[personal-site](https://github.com/kylemcd/personal-site) - [kylemcd.com](https://kylemcd.com)
   - My personal site where you can find what I've been up to day to day, my writings, and more. This is my playground for trying new things.
[@kpm-tools/segment-next](https://github.com/kpm-tools/segment-next)
   - A little wrapper around [Segment](https://segment.com) that focuses on making DX better in Next.js 
[@kpm-tools/shortcut-action](https://github.com/kpm-tools/shortcut-action)
   - A GitHub action to granularly move [shortcut](https://shortcut.com) stories based on Git/GitHub events.

ðŸ”¨ Currently Building
- Cross Platform CSS Solution that compiles for Web & React Native that utilizes web standards and translates to React Native
- An API shape validator that runs at dev, test, build, and run time that you can use alongside typescript validation. Will also support being ran against BE repositories for validation before BE releases.
