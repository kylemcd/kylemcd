### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Kyle McDonald

During my day to day, I run the engineering organization over at [@foxtrotco](https://github.com/foxtrotco). I primarily focus on the front-end, more specifically React, but I like to go down lots of rabbit holes. 

Here's some of my open-source work:

- [dotfiles (neovim, oh-my-zsh, tmux)](https://github.com/kylemcd.com/dotfiles)
   - This is where I keep all my config (that changes quite frequently) for my local tooling.
- [@kpm-tools/segment-next](https://github.com/kpm-tools/segment-next)
   - A little wrapper around [Segment](https://segment.com) that focuses on making DX better in Next.js 
- [personal-site](https://github.com/kylemcd/personal-site) - [kylemcd.com](https://kylemcd.com)
   - My personal site where you can find what I've been up to day to day, my writings, and more. This is my playground for trying new things.
   
   
 - Some legacy repo's I brought into compatibiliy with React 18
   - [react-google-maps](https://github.com/kylemcd/react-google-maps)
   - [react-scrollable-accordion](https://github.com/kylemcd/react-scrollable-accordion)
   - [react-geosuggest](https://github.com/kylemcd/react-geosuggest)
   - [react-albus](https://github.com/kylemcd/react-albus)
   - [react-lazyload](https://github.com/kylemcd/react-lazyload)
